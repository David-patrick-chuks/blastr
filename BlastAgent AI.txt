# BLASTAGENT AI: COMPREHENSIVE PROJECT REPORT

## 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
BlastAgent AI is a high-volume, AI-driven email orchestration platform built for personalized outreach. Originally developed on the GAIA legacy framework, the platform has been fully overhauled to serve as a specialized tool for email marketers, sales teams, and developers who require Gemini-powered intelligence with reliable SMTP delivery.

**Core Objective:** To transform complex lead data into high-conversion email campaigns via zero-shot personalization and neural context retrieval.

## 2. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### 2.1 FRONTEND STACK
- **Framework:** React 18+ with TypeScript.
- **Build System:** Vite (optimized for sub-second hot module replacement).
- **Styling:** Vanilla CSS with a unified "Active Blue" minimalist design system.
- **Icons:** Lucide React for consistent, high-end symbology.
- **State Management:** React Hooks (useState/useEffect) with deep service integration.
- **Real-time Engine:** Socket.io-client for real-time AI response streaming in the Email Composer.

### 2.2 BACKEND STACK (BLASTAGENT CORE)
- **Runtime:** Node.js with Express and TypeScript.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Active storage for Campaigns, Messages, and Analytics).
- **Vector Intelligence:** `pgvector` extension for storing and querying high-dimensional embeddings.
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth (Integrated for secure JWT-based identity management).
- **AI Engine:** Google Gemini 2.0 (Integrated for text generation, embeddings, and vision processing).
- **Mail Engine:** Custom SMTP orchestration layer for high-deliverability outbound mail.

## 3. THE TRANSFORMATION JOURNEY (GAIA -> BLASTAGENT)

### PHASE 1: BRANDING & IDENTITY PURGE
- **Global Purge:** Removed all instances of "GAIA", "Kernel", and "CLI" from the codebase.
- **Landing Page Redesign:** Developed a premium dark-mode landing page featuring "The Ultimate Email Pipeline" visualization.
- **Public Guides:** Created a user-facing **SMTP App Password Guide** (`/guide/smtp`) to solve common onboarding friction points with Google Workspace and Outlook.

### PHASE 2: TERMINOLOGY & DATA STANDARDIZATION
- **Database Refactor:** Migrated the `agents` model to a strictly bounded `campaigns` model. Updated all foreign keys in `documents`, `messages`, and `activity_logs`.
- **Service Transformation:** 
    - `agentService.ts` -> `campaignService.ts`
    - `agentController.ts` -> Simplified CRUD for Campaign management.
    - `analyticsController.ts` -> Rebranded to provide Campaign-specific KPIs (Open-rates, Token usage, Delivery status).

### PHASE 3: FEATURE HARDENING
- **Social Cleanup:** Deleted 8 legacy services (WhatsApp, Slack, Discord, etc.) and their associated controllers to reduce the attack surface and bundle size.
- **SMTP Suite:** Built a dedicated frontend settings view for managing outbound mail servers, integrated with the backend's encrypted profile storage.
- **Neural Context Retrieval:** Optimized the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline to inject campaign-specific knowledge base data into the AI composer in real-time.

## 4. KEY FEATURES & CAPABILITIES

### AI-POWERED EMAIL COMPOSER (STUDIO)
- **Real-time Streaming:** Uses WebSockets (Socket.io) to provide a typing effect for AI-generated drafts.
- **Context Injection:** Automatically pulls relevant facts from the campaign's knowledge base to ensure personalization is factually accurate.

### IMAGE-BASED RECIPIENT EXTRACTION
- **Gemini Vision:** Users can upload screenshots of lead lists.
- **Neural Parsing:** The system extracts emails, validates formats, and syncs them directly into a campaign's recipient list.

### SYSTEM SECURITY & PRIVACY
- **Auth Hardening:** Removed GitHub OAuth to maintain a single, secure identity provider (Google).
- **Campaign Isolation:** Strict user-level and campaign-level data isolation implemented at the database query level.
- **Technical Specs:** Truthful reporting of "Contextual Logic" and "AES-256 Data Protection" in the security dashboard.

## 5. REPOSITORY STATUS & VERIFICATION
- **Backend Build:** `tsc` (Passed)
- **Frontend Build:** `vite build` (Passed)
- **Connectivity:** Full E2E verified from Landing Page -> Auth -> Dashboard -> Campaign Creation -> SMTP Config.
