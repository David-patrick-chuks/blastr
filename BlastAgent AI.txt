# BlastAgent AI - Project Summary

BlastAgent AI is a specialized, high-performance email orchestration platform designed for high-volume, Gemini-powered outreach. The project has undergone a complete transformation from its legacy "GAIA" roots into a streamlined, production-ready AI email blasting system.

## Project Vision
To provide a seamless pipeline for defining campaigns, extracting recipient lists via AI Vision, and delivering high-impact personalized messages via secure SMTP infrastructure.

## Key Accomplishments & Technical Milestones

### 1. Brand Transformation & UI Refinement
- **Rebranding:** Successfully migrated all branding from "GAIA" and "CLI" to **BlastAgent AI**.
- **Landing Page Evolution:** Redesigned the public site to focus on Email Blasting, SMTP Delivery, and AI Extraction. Updated "How It Works" with realistic pipeline code snippets.
- **Enhanced Navigation:** Integrated a dedicated **SMTP App Password Guide** with video resources to improve user onboarding.
- **Unified Aesthetic:** Standardized the color palette (Active Blue accents) and typography across the dashboard, composer, and landing pages.

### 2. Backend Lean-up & Optimization
- **Legacy Purge:** Removed 8+ unused social integration services (WhatsApp, Discord, Slack, etc.) and legacy REST chat controllers.
- **Architecture Shift:** Fully transitioned AI Composer interactions to **Socket.io** for real-time streaming, improving performance and responsiveness.
- **Terminology Standardization:** Renamed all internal models and API routes from "Agents" to "**Campaigns**" to align with the core business logic.
- **Clean Startup:** Refined `server.ts` to remove obsolete connection restoration services and logic.

### 3. Feature Enhancements
- **SMTP Configuration Suite:** Built a robust settings interface for managing outbound mail servers and testing connectivity.
- **AI Vision Integration:** Connected the image-based email extractor directly to the Campaign model, allowing users to sync recipients from screenshots to outreach lists in one click.
- **Neural Context Retrieval:** Optimized the Knowledge Base to provide high-fidelity RAG context for personalized email drafting.

### 4. Security & Hardening
- **Authentication:** Completely decommissioned GitHub OAuth to focus on a secure Google and Email/Password flow.
- **Privacy Claims:** Standardized the Security dashboard with truthful claims, replacing "Vector Indexing" placeholders with "Contextual Logic" and "Campaign Isolation" technical specs.
- **Build Stability:** Achieved a zero-error build state for both the React frontend and TypeScript backend.

## Current Status
The platform is fully rebranded, lean, and optimized for its primary objective: **AI-Driven Email Excellence.**
